## Who interacts with Mangrove

There are 3 types of actors in play:

* Offer makers add [liquidity promises](mangrove-core/explanations/offer-maker/) to Mangrove. They own offers in [offer lists](data-structures/market.md) and must manage contracts that react to [offer execution](data-structures/offer-data-structures.md).
* Takers go to Mangrove to [find liquidity](mangrove-core/explanations/offer-taker.md) by executing offers already in Mangrove.
* [Governance](meta-topics/governance.md) adjusts Mangrove parameters, opens new pairs, sets fees, etc.
